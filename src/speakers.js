    bio: "Lukas leads Google's Web Security team, safeguarding its vast and complex web application ecosystem. He's driven by a vision of secure-by-default web development, aiming to make vulnerabilities like XSS a relic of the past – much like memory corruption bugs are largely forgotten by Java developers. At Google, Lukas champions secure-by-default platforms and the strategic deployment of cutting-edge security features (CSP, Trusted Types, Fetch Metadata, COOP, etc.) at a massive scale. His team's work has significantly hardened Google's web security posture and spearheaded many multi-year efforts to engineer away entire classes of vulnerabilities. As a W3C WebAppSec working group member, Lukas actively shapes global web security specifications, including contributions to CSP3 and Trusted Types. His passion for CSP led him to create the CSP Evaluator, empowering engineers to easily assess their policies' strength against XSS attacks.",
