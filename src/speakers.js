His team's work has significantly hardened Google's web security posture and spearheaded many multi-year efforts to engineer away entire classes of vulnerabilities. As a W3C WebAppSec working group member, Lukas actively shapes global web security specifications, including contributions to CSP3 and Trusted Types. His passion for CSP led him to create the CSP Evaluator, empowering engineers to easily assess their policies' strength against XSS attacks.",
